## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have [Node.js (18+)](https://nodejs.org/) and [Python (3.8+)](https://www.python.org/) installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SYEDTUFAILANDRABI/Circuit.IQ.git
cd Circuit.IQ

# Install Python requirements
pip install -r LABback-IQ/requirements.txt

# Install 3D Simulator packages
cd LABfront-IQ-3D && npm install && cd ..

# Install React Website packages
cd "circuit.iq (1)final" && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Environment (Optional)
Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp LABback-IQ/.env.example LABback-IQ/.env
```
Open `LABback-IQ/.env` and optionally add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` for AI tutoring. If left blank, the app will gracefully fall back to local rule-based physics formulas.

### 3. Run in Development Mode
Start both frontend and backend servers simultaneously:
```bash
python start_dev.py
```
This automatically opens **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. Choose an experiment and click **Launch Lab** to start!

## 🏗️ Production Build & Deploy

To build the entire project for production deployment, run the automated build script:
```bash
python build_all.py
```
This builds the 3D Simulator, copies the bundles to the React public assets folder, compiles the React portal into `circuit.iq (1)final/dist/`, and primes the backend server to serve it directly.

Once built, launch the production server:
```bash
cd LABback-IQ
python main.py
```
Go to **http://localhost:5000** to access the production build.

## 🛠️ Performance & Troubleshooting

### WebGL Context Management (Memory Leaks Fixed)
To ensure the application runs smoothly without crashing the browser:
*   **WebGL Context Limits**: Chrome limits active WebGL contexts per session. We have implemented clean disposal logic where the `THREE.WebGLRenderer` context is explicitly lost (`WEBGL_lose_context` extension) and disposed of immediately when the simulator iframe is reloaded or unmounted.
*   **React Post-Processing Bloom**: If you encounter low framerates on low-end machines, toggle **High Fidelity Mode** in the settings panel to disable resource-heavy post-processing bloom.
