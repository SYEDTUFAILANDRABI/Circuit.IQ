# ⚡ Circuit.IQ — 3D Lab Simulator

> The interactive 3D breadboard where students build circuits, draw wires, and run physics experiments.

---

## What This Does

This is the **heart** of Circuit.IQ — a Three.js application that renders a photorealistic breadboard and lets students:

- 🔌 **Drag and drop** components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, etc.)
- 🔗 **Draw wires** between breadboard holes with automatic color coding
- ⚡ **Simulate circuits** with live voltage, current, and power meters
- 📊 **View waveforms** on an oscilloscope and plot V-I graphs
- 📄 **Generate PDF lab reports** with recorded data and grading
- 💾 **Auto-save** circuits to the database (restored exactly on reload)

This app runs inside an **iframe** embedded in the React website.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Development (standalone):
```bash
cd LABfront-IQ-3D
npm install
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:5173
```

### With the full app:
```bash
# From project root:
python start_dev.py    # Starts everything
```

### Build for production:
```bash
npm run build     # Outputs to dist/
# Then run build_all.py from project root to copy files
```

## 🔧 How the Breadboard Works

### Snap Points (Holes)

The breadboard is a grid of **holes** indexed 0–883:

```
snap index = row × 14 + column

Row 0–29, Column 0–13 = 420 main holes
Special: snap 882 = positive rail, snap 883 = negative rail
```

### Component Types

| Component | What it looks like | Holes it spans |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| `source` | DC Power Supply | 2 holes |
| `resistor` | Ceramic with color bands | 5 holes |
| `capacitor` | Electrolytic cylinder | 4 holes |
| `inductor` | Toroid coil | 5 holes |
| `led` | Light Emitting Diode | 2 holes |
| `diode` | PN Junction | 3 holes |
| `ammeter` | Current meter | 5 holes |
| `voltmeter` | Voltage meter | 5 holes |
| `button` | Push switch | Crosses center ravine |

### How Components Get Placed

```
Drag chip from sidebar → ghost preview follows mouse → drop on hole
    → placeComponent3D(type, snap1, snap2)
    → 3D mesh appears in scene
    → auto-saves to database
```

## 🔗 How Wires Work

### Drawing a Wire

```
Select "Wire" tool → click start hole → click end hole
    → create3DWire(snap1, snap2, isUserClick=true)
    → Bézier curve calculated → colored tube rendered
    → 4 electron particles added for animation
```

### Wire Colors

| Wire connects to... | Color |
|---------------------|-------|
| Positive power rail | 🔴 Red |
| Negative/ground rail | ⚫ Black |
| Signal (1st wire) | 🔵 Blue |
| Signal (2nd wire) | 🟢 Green |
| Signal (3rd wire) | 🟠 Orange |
| Signal (4th wire) | 🟣 Purple |

### Overlap Prevention

Wires automatically stack vertically so they don't cross through each other or through components.

### Reload Fidelity

When loading saved circuits:
- `create3DWire(fromHole, toHole, false)` — the `false` flag **skips** snap redirection
- This means wires appear in the **exact same position** they were saved in
- User-drawn wires use `true` so snapping to valid holes still works

---

## 💾 Save & Load System

### Saving (automatic)

Every time you place a component or draw a wire:
```
→ POST /api/db/save-circuit
  {
    experiment_type, user_id,
    circuit_data: { placedComponents, wires, params }
  }
```

### Loading (on page load)

```
→ GET /api/db/load-circuit?experiment_type=ohms&user_id=...
  → Rebuild each component: placeComponent3D(type, snap1, snap2)
  → Rebuild each wire: create3DWire(fromHole, toHole, false)
  → Restore slider values: updateParameterValue(key, value)
```

## ❓ Common Problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| White screen | Open browser console (F12) → check for errors |
| 3D models missing | Verify files exist in `public/models/` |
| API calls failing | Make sure backend is running on port 5000 |
| Wires shifting on reload | The `false` flag in `loadCircuitFromBackend` should fix this |
| PDF won't download | Allow pop-ups for localhost in browser settings |
| Build errors | `npm install` then `npm run build` |
